Version 0.7.0 (2020-05-07)
==========================

The main highlight of the v0.7.0 release is the introduction of the new
I/O interface. With this common interface, the dive computer backends
can more easily use different I/O implementations at runtime, including
an application defined one. This is needed to support Bluetooth Low
Energy (BLE), for which there is no built-in implementation available.

Due to the fundamental changes to the I/O layer, this release is not
backwards compatible.

release. Applications will have to be updated to support the new
features!
